### Summary

This is the repository for my own portfolio site but it's also a rad Jekyll theme I built for anyone to use.

### Fancy using it for your own site?

Here are some steps to get you started:

1. Clone this repo and cd into the directory:

  `git clone https://github.com/jamigibbs/portfolio.git your-dir-name`
  `cd your-dir-name`

2. Run Jekyll:

  `jekyll serve --watch`

  _Don't have Jekyll yet? [Get `er installed then!](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)_

3. Visit in your browser at:

  `http://127.0.0.1:4000`

## Launching with Github Pages :rocket:

1. Update the `CNAME` file with your own domain

2. [Configure your domain with your DNS provider](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/). Alternately, you can use the default Github url (ie. http://username.github.io/repository) and not bother messing around with a custom domain
