### Summary

This is the repository for my own portfolio site. It's built using:

- [Foundation 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Magic](http://giphy.com/gifs/VHngktboAlxHW)

### Fork Me

You're welcome to use this repo as a starting point for your own portfolio with Github Pages. Here are some steps to get you started:

1. Update the `CNAME` file with your own domain

2. [Configure your domain with your DNS provider](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/). Alternately, you can use the default Github url (ie. http://username.github.io/repository) and not bother messing around with a custom domain

3. Install Sass if you don't have it already:

  ```
  gem install sass
  ```

4. Navigate to your project folder and begin compiling your Sass:

  ```
  sass --watch scss/style.scss:css/style.css
  ```

  If youâ€™re working on a large project with many Sass files, you can tell Sass to just watch your Sass directory and update your CSS directory.
  Once my project is all set up, I like to use the command:

  ```
  sass --watch scss:css
  ```

5. Push changes back into the `gh-pages` branch and watch them go live.
